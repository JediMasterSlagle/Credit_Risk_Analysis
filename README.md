# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Machine Learning Models
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk alalysis, After data cleaning.

### Basic Cleaned Data

split my data using the resampled data to train and test a logistic regression model. Also, calculated balanced accuracy scores then printed confusion matrix and finally generated classification reports as results.
### Split Data into Trainingand Testing

## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling

### Balanced Random Forest Classifying

- Also, sorted importance and features in descending order.

## Summary
This analysis is trying to find the best model for loan risk. We need to find a model that lets the least amount of high risk loans. Sampling the models, the scored highest were:
  - Easy Ensemble model has the highest accuracy score (0.93) and the F-1 score for low risk (0.97) is also the highest.
    - The recommended model for credit card analysis would be the Easy Ensemble model.
  - Balanced Random Rainforest model has the second highest accuracy score at 0.79 and the F-1 low score is 0.93.
  - Na√Øve Random Oversampling model has an accuracy of 0.65 and a F-1 score of 0.74 for low risk.
  - SMOTE model has an accuracy score of 0.66 and the F-1 score is 0.82 for low risk.
  - UnderSampling has the lowest accuracy score at 0.54 and F-1 score of 0.70.


the best model for predicting high risk loans is the Easy Ensemble Classifying model.
